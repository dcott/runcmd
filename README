The runcmd.sh script is used to execute a shell command on large numbers
systems via ssh. Commands can be run in series or in parallel. Output
can be redirected to a separate log file for each host.

Public key authentication should be configured for your account on each
host. The ssh command uses BatchMode and disables StrictHostKeyChecking
to make things a bit more seemless. See ssh_config(5) for more details.

The -f options requires a file with a list of hostnames in the following
format:

HOSTS="host1 host2 host3 ..."

The file is simply sourced and the HOSTS variable used.
